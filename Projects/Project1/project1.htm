<h1>Website Critiques</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Website 1 Critique - Sabl&eacute;tine</h2>
<h4><a href="https://sabletine.com/index.html">www.sabletine.com</a></h4>

<ol>
		<li>My first impression of this site is that it looks like a  simple,nice, and clean website.</li>
		<li>This site uses tabbed links along the top of the page with a Twitter feed along the lower right side of the page.</li>
		<li>The site structure is simple and easy to understand. The tabs take you to individual pages that talks about the different products the bakery makes. Some of the tabs have a link within that takes you to related information.</li>
		<li>I feel like the graphics and layout enhances the site. It is all about their bakery and has images that show their products. The pictures are visually enticing.</li>
		<li>Load time was really quick, which is to be expected with how simple the layout is.</li>
		<li>The text color and size is readable. I would've maybe inserted a little more space between tabs, but that would just be my preference. It goes well with the French classy theme.</li>
		<li>This site has a simple tabbed navigation bar that shows up on every page so you can go from tab to tab or page to page without having to go to the Home page every time. Clicking on the name of the shop takes you back to the Home page. </li>
		<li>The color scheme is a simple black and white scheme with pictures being the main point of each page display.</li>
		<li>Unfortunately this site does not have a responsive design. When making the page smaller you have to scroll over to read the page rather than have it automatically fit to the window size. </li>
		<li>I really liked that they had the twitter feed embeded into the page without having to click over to Twitter to see it.</li>

<h2>Website 2 Critique - Jami Lin</h2>
<h4><a href="https://jamilin.com/">www.jamilin.com</a></h4>
<ol>
		<li>My first impression of this site is, "<strong><em>HOLY COW!</em></strong> What is going on here?!" There's just so much stuff!</li>
		<li>This site has links all over the place! There's just so much stuff on the page that I can't really see an organized flow of information. If there's a scheme it would be that there's a "let me sell you something" vibe. It feels like an infomercial.</li>
		<li>This site's structure really confuses me. There's just so much information crammed in on one page...actually it's the same on most of the pages.</li>
		<li>The graphics and multimedia on this site definitely detract from it. It makes it so busy that I don't even want to take the time to see if there is any real value to the links.</li>
		<li>The first time I opened it, it took a bit longer to open, however, I'm not sure if it was because my internet was being slow or if it was because of all the stuff that had to be loaded onto the page. Subsequent times I got on the page it loaded fairly quickly.</li>
		<li>The text color and size of the text was readable, for the most part. It was just so busy that it wasn't as easy to read. The background color on the home page was the only thing that wasn't <strong>LOUD</strong>.</li>
		<li>This site does have a link to a sitemap. I wouldn't say that the navigation tool was well done. It was still confusing for me.</li>
		<li>It seems that they were trying to go for a rainbow color scheme, but it didn't stay consistent throughout the site.</li>
		<li>This site did not have a responsive design.</li>
		<li>This site offered an unusually busy looking site design.</li>

<h2>Website 3 Critique - Utah National Parks</h2>
<h4><a href="https://utah.com/national-parks">www.utah.com/national-parks.com</a></h4>

<ol>
		<li>My first impression of this site was that it seemed to be professionally done. It looked nice too.</li>
		<li>The flow of information was organized via a dropdown menu on the right upper corner that would take you to different parts of the website. It also had links on the left to specific parks that provided more information on them with additional links related to the destination.</li>
		<li>This site's structure makes sense to me. It's organized into groups and subgroups within that, in my mind, makes it a nice tidy package.</li>
		<li>The graphics/layout/multimedia on this website enhances the site. The images relate well to the link clicked. </li>
		<li>The first time I loaded this page it seemed to take a bit longer, perhaps because of the images, but perhaps because of a bad internet connection at the time. When I went back to it later it seemed to load in an acceptable amount of time.</li>
		<li>The text color and size of font on this site was readable. It helped make other keywords stand out a little more since the text wasn't a straight  black clolor, but more of a dark gray. Some key words were bolded and in a solild black color making it stand out. The lighter gray toned background went well with all the images they posted and helped Headings and other links stand out.</li>
		<li>Yes, this site had a dropdown navigation tool. It was well done and took you to where it said it would take you.</li>
		<li>I felt like the color scheme on this website was a nice neutral that helped showcase the images posted on the site. The look and feel of the site was consistent through all the pages.</li>
		<li>This site used a responsive design, which was super nice when I had to make the screen smaller and I didn't have to scroll over to read the rest of a paragraph.</li>
		<li>I really liked the variety of ways they used headings, color, lines, as well as pictures that helped separate the information into different groupings that still felt uniform across the website. I also really liked that they included a search bar for the site.</li>
